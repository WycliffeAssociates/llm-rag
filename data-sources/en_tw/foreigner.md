## Definition:

The term "foreigner" refers to a person living in a country that is not his own. Another name for a foreigner is an "alien."

* In the Old Testament, this term especially refers to anyone who came from a different people group than the people he was living among.
* A foreigner is also a person whose language and culture is different from those of a particular region.
* For example, when Naomi and her family moved to Moab, they were foreigners there. When Naomi and her daughter-in-law Ruth later moved to Israel, Ruth was called a "foreigner" there because she was not originally from Israel.
* The apostle Paul told the Ephesians that before they knew Christ, they were "foreigners" to God's covenant.
* Sometimes "foreigner" is translated as "stranger," but it should not refer only to someone who is unfamiliar or unknown.
* A "sojourner" is a person who is living in one country that is not his but waiting for the chance to move to his own country.
* A "barbarian" is a person from another country who does not speak the local language or obey the local customs and so the natives do not like or respect him.
* A "strangers" are persons who do not know each other.
* To be "alienated" is to no longer be living in loving relationship with another. For example, a husband and wife who are no longer living together but are not divorced are "alienated" or "estranged."
* A "tenant" is a person who rents his dwelling place.
