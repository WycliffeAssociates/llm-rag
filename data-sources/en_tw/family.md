## Definition:

The term "family" refers to a group of people who are related by blood and usually includes a father, mother, and their children. It often also includes other relatives such as grandparents, grandchildren, uncles and aunts.

* The Hebrew family was a religious community passing on traditions through worship and instruction.
* Usually the father was the major authority of the family.
* Family could also include servants, concubines, and even foreigners.
* Some languages may have a broader word such as "clan" or "household" that would fit better in contexts where more than just parents and children are being referred to.
* The term "family" is also used to refer to people who are related spiritually, such as people who are part of God's family because they believe in Jesus.
* A "genealogy" is a record of a person's family that tells who his ancestors were.
