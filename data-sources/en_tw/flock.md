## Definition:

In the Bible, "flock" refers to a group of sheep or goats and "herd" refers to a group of cattle, oxen, or pigs.

* Different languages may have different ways of naming groups of animals or birds.
* For example, in English the term "herd" can also be used for sheep or goats, but in the Bible text it is not used this way.
* The term "flock" in English is also used for a group of birds, but it can not be used for pigs, oxen, or cattle.
* Consider what terms are used in your language to refer to different groups of animals.
* For verses that refer to "flocks and herds" it may be better to add "of sheep" or "of cattle" for example, if the language does not have different words to refer to different kinds of animal groups.
