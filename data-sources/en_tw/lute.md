# lute

## Definition:

A lute is a small, stringed, musical instrument that the Israelites used when they worshiped God.

* A lute is very similar to a modern-day acoustic guitar, having a wooden sound box and an extended neck on which strings are strung.
* In playing a lute, certain strings are held down with the fingers of one hand while these and other strings are plucked or strummed with the other hand.
* The number of strings varied, but the Old Testament specifically mentions instruments that had ten strings.
