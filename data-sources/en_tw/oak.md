## Translation Suggestions:

* Many translations will find it important to use the term "oak tree" rather than just the word "oak."
* If oak trees are not known in the receptor area, "an oak" could be translated as "an oak, which is a large shade tree like…," then give the name of a local tree that has similar characteristics.
